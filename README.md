## RAG Evaluation with RAGAS
RAGAs is an open-source framework that helps developers evaluate and test Large Language Model (LLM) applications, particularly Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines.

RAGAs uses LLMs to measure key performance metrics, such as retrieved contexts, answer correctness, faithfullness, context relevancy, etc

This notebook shows how you can integrate their (RAGAS) excellent RAG metrics in LangSmith to evaluate your RAG app.
